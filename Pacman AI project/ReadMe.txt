Implemented various informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and 
reinforcement learning algorithms in Pacman AI project (designed at UC Berkley), using Python

In this showcase I am only including files which have been modified by me. (under ***YOUR CODE HERE***)
The complete code base for Pacman AI can be found at UC Berkley's CS188 website.
